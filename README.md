# Using constructor and this keyword in java
This code splits the Student and Main classes into separate files, Student.java and Main.java respectively. You can compile and run the Main.java file to execute the program.

In this program, we have a Student class with private instance variables rollNo, name, subject, and mark. 
The constructor is used to initialize these variables when creating an instance of the class. 
The getter and setter methods allow accessing and modifying the private variables.
